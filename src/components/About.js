                        My name is Steven and I am a student of California State University Fullerton pursuing a bachelor's in
                        Computer Science with a concentration on Cybersecurity. I am looking for any professional opportunities 
                        in the field to further my knowledge to get a start in my professional career.
                        <br /><br />
                        I thoroughly enjoy learning about the different aspects of technology, and am captivated by the wide range of
                        knowledge required to thrive in the field. I have been studying programming, networking, operating systems, and 
                        cybersecurity for most of my academic career.
                        <br /><br />
                        I spend a lot of my free time learning through resources such as TryHackMe, HackTheBox, BlueTeamOnline, and Udemy.
                        With beginner CTF opportunities through the Offensive Security Society Club at Cal State Fullerton. I am currently 
                        working on advancing my blue team skills, and expanding my portfolio while studying for the CompTIA Security+ Certification.
